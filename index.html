    <h1> Quick Hummus recipe </h1>

    <h2> What is Hummus? </h2>

    <p>Hummus is a popular Middle Eastern dip or spread made primarily from mashed cooked chickpeas blended with tahini ( a paste of ground sesame seeds), lemon juice, and garlic. It is known for its smooth, creamy texture and is often garnished with olive oil, a sprinkle of paprika, and whole chickpeas.</p>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
   <li>1 can ( 400g ) of chick peas ( Garbanzo beans )</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
   <li> 6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of Cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
   <li>A dash of olive oil</li> 
</ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse " chunky " Hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
   <li>If you want a smooth Hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>

    <li>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</li>

    <li>For storage put in the refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</li>
    </ol>
